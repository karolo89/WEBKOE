The original article, published on FiveThirtyEight, explores the limitations of using past hurricane seasons to predict future patterns. Our focus will be on practicing our data visualization skills using the powerful ggplot2 library in R.\n\n### Data Source and Preparation\nTo recreate the graph, we need the raw data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) HURDAT2 database. This database contains records of all Atlantic basin tropical cyclones dating back to 1851. For simplicity, we skip the data manipulation steps and provide the dataset in our GitHub repository.\n\n### Graph Creation\nWe start by loading the necessary libraries and fetching the dataset from our GitHub repository using RCurl. Once the data is imported, we can proceed with creating the graph using ggplot2. The graph showcases the 15-year average recorded Atlantic basin hurricanes from 1851 to 2019.\n\n### Graph Features\nThe graph is constructed using geom_step to represent the average hurricane count over time. Additionally, we include text annotations to indicate different types of hurricanes, such as \"All Hurricanes\" and \"Major Hurricanes.\" The graph is color-coded to differentiate between different hurricane types using hex colors obtained from the original graph using the Image Color Picker tool.\n\n### Graph Customization\nTo enhance the visual appeal, we customize various aspects of the graph. This includes adjusting scales for the x and y axes, removing gridlines, modifying axis ticks and lines, and applying a minimal theme. The title of the graph, \"15-year average recorded Atlantic basin hurricanes, 1851-2019,\" provides a clear indication of the data presented.\n\n### Footer\nTo complete the recreation, we add a footer displaying the source of the data and attribution. The footer consists of the text \"FiveThirtyEight\" and \"SOURCES: HURDAT2, VECCHI ET AL\" aligned at the bottom of the graph.\n\n### Conclusion\nBy following the step-by-step process outlined in this article, we successfully recreated the graph from Anna Wiederkehr's insightful article on hurricane seasons. Through the use of ggplot2 and various customization techniques, we were able to visualize the 15-year average recorded Atlantic basin hurricanes from 1851 to 2019. This exercise serves as an excellent opportunity to enhance our data visualization skills and gain insights into the impact of past hurricane seasons on future predictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## library(ggplot2)\n## library(geomtextpath)\n## library(RCurl)\n## library(grid)\n## library(gridExtra)\n\nx <- getURL(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karolo89/Raw_Data/main/Hurricane.csv\")\nhurricane <- read.csv(text = x)\n\ngraph1 <- ggplot(hurricane, aes(year,average, color = type)) +\n  geom_step(size=.7) +\n  \n## Adding the text\n  geom_textline(aes(label = ifelse(type == \"avg_h_15year\", \n                    \"All Hurricanes\",\n                    \"Major Hurricanes\"), \n                    y = average + .8), \n                text_smoothing = 50, \n                fontface = 2,\n                hjust = 0,  \n                linetype = 0, \n                size = 3) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1886, y = 2.2, label = \"Category 3 - 5\", hjust = 0,\n           color = \"#3b2d74\", size= 2.5) +\n\n## Scales\n  \n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1860,2020,20)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,8.5),\n                     breaks = seq(2,8,2),\n                     expand = c(0,0)) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#735ad2\", \"#3b2d74\")) +\n\n## Labs\n  \n  labs(\n    y = \" \",\n    x = \" \", \n    title = \"15-year average recorded Atlantic basin hurricanes, 1851-2019\") +\n  \n## Theme \n  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  \n  theme(\n    \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    \n    ## Customize x axis\n    axis.ticks.x = element_line(colour = \"#e1e1e1\"),\n    axis.ticks.length.x =unit(0.3,\"cm\"),\n    axis.line.x.bottom = element_line(colour = \"#313131\"),\n    \n    ## axis text\n\n    axis.text = element_text(size= 6, color= \"#8f8f8f\", \n                             face = \"bold\"),\n    \n    ## We don't want a legend\n    \n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    \n    ## title\n    plot.title = element_text(size =8, face = \"bold\", colour= \"#545454\",\n                              hjust = 0.50, vjust = 1)\n  )\ngraph1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hurricane_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI used the [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en) tool to get the hex colors from the original graph.\n\nWe are still missing the footer, so let's add it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfooter<- grobTree( \n                  textGrob(\"      FiveThirtyEight\", x=unit(.05, \"npc\"), \n                      gp=gpar(col=\"#868686\", \n                              family=\"sans\", \n                              fontsize= 5.5,\n                              fontface= \"bold\"),\n                      hjust=0,\n                      vjust = -2),\n                  \n                  textGrob(\"SOURCES: HURDAT2, VECCHI ET AL      \",\n                        x=unit(1, \"npc\"), \n                        gp=gpar(col=\"#868686\", \n                                family= \"sans\",\n                                fontsize=5.5,\n                              fontface= \"bold\"),\n                        hjust=1,\n                      vjust = -2))\n                  \n# Plot All Together\n\n plt.final <- grid.arrange(graph1, footer, heights=unit(c(0.72, 0.03), \n                                                    c(\"npc\", \"npc\")))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hurricane_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote: The recreated graph is displayed in the article, but please refer to the original article on FiveThirtyEight for a more detailed analysis and interpretation of the data.\n\n",
