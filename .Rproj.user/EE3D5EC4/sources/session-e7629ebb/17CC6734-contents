## Introduction

The purpose of this business report is to provide an overview of a project that analyzed a customer database from a mall. The project aimed to uncover underlying patterns in the customer base and group customers into segments, known as market segmentation. By understanding these segments, the marketing team can adopt a more targeted approach to reach consumers, and the mall can make informed strategic decisions to increase profits.

## Dataset and Methods Used

The dataset used in this analysis is a customer database from a mall, containing 200 observations with basic information such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The analysis was performed using the R programming language. Exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization, and unsupervised machine learning techniques (K-Means Clustering) were employed to achieve the project objectives.
