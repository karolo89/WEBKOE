I am originally from Barranquilla, Colombia, a city located in the northern region of Colombia on the Caribbean coast. It is the fourth-largest city in the country and an important economic and cultural center in the Caribbean region. Barranquilla is known for its vibrant culture and festive atmosphere, exemplified by its famous [Carnival of Barranquilla](https://carnavaldebarranquilla.org/).\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(leaflet)\nleaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\n  addMarkers(lng=-74.77028, lat=10.98611, popup=\"The birthplace of R\")\n```\n\nAs a graduated engineer, I have acquired extensive experience and problem--solving expertise in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and model development. Since effective communication of data is of paramount importance, I have subsequently developed strong skills in data visualization and business knowledge. I hold an MBA from Willamette University and currently pursuing a second master's in Data Science.\n\nI have experience working in the public and private sectors helping organizations to embrace shared value by positively impacting society and the environment: The sweet spot where profit meets purpose.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"code-summary":"Behind the Scenes"},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","editor":"visual","citations-hover":true,"footnotes-hover":true,"theme":{"light":"LightTheme.css","dark":"DarkTheme.scss"},"code-copy":true,"title":"Hello!
