## Introduction:

I conducted a customer satisfaction analysis for a service-based organization to assess customer satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement. The analysis involved data cleaning, calculation of satisfaction scores, statistical analysis (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to identify significant differences, and visualization of results using charts and graphs.
