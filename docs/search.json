I am originally from Barranquilla, Colombia, a city located in the northern region of Colombia on the Caribbean coast. It is the fourth-largest city in the country and an important economic and cultural center in the Caribbean region. Barranquilla is known for its vibrant culture and festive atmosphere, exemplified by its famous Carnival of Barranquilla.\n\nlibrary(leaflet)\nleaflet() %>%\n  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles\n  addMarkers(lng=-74.77028, lat=10.98611, popup=\"The birthplace of R\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a graduated engineer, I have acquired extensive experience and problem–solving expertise in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and model development. Since effective communication of data is of paramount importance, I have subsequently developed strong skills in data visualization and business knowledge. I hold an MBA from Willamette University and currently pursuing a second master’s in Data Science.\nI have experience working in the public and private sectors helping organizations to embrace Shared Value by positively impacting society and the environment: The sweet spot where profit meets purpose."
