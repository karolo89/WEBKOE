My name is Karol Orozco; I live in Portland, OR, with my husband, two kids, and my dog Lucy. I am originally from Barranquilla, Colombia, a city located in the northern region of Colombia on the Caribbean coast. It is the fourth-largest city in the country and an important economic and cultural center in the Caribbean region. Barranquilla is known for its vibrant culture and festive atmosphere, exemplified by its famous [Carnival of Barranquilla](https://carnavaldebarranquilla.org/).

As a graduated engineer, I have acquired extensive experience and problem--solving expertise in data wrangling, statistical analysis, and model development. Since effective communication of data is of paramount importance, I have subsequently developed strong skills in data visualization and business knowledge. I hold an MBA from Willamette University and currently pursuing a second master's in Data Science.

I have experience working in the public and private sectors helping organizations to embrace Shared Value by positively impacting society and the environment: The sweet spot where profit meets purpose.
