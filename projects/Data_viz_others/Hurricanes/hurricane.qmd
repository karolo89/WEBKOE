### Introduction
In this article, we will dive into the process of recreating a graph from the informative article titled "Why Past Hurricane Seasons Don't Tell Us Much About The Future" by Anna Wiederkehr. The original article, published on FiveThirtyEight, explores the limitations of using past hurricane seasons to predict future patterns. Our focus will be on practicing our data visualization skills using the powerful ggplot2 library in R.

### Data Source and Preparation
To recreate the graph, we need the raw data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) HURDAT2 database. This database contains records of all Atlantic basin tropical cyclones dating back to 1851. For simplicity, we skip the data manipulation steps and provide the dataset in our GitHub repository.

### Graph Creation
We start by loading the necessary libraries and fetching the dataset from our GitHub repository using RCurl. Once the data is imported, we can proceed with creating the graph using ggplot2. The graph showcases the 15-year average recorded Atlantic basin hurricanes from 1851 to 2019.

### Graph Features
The graph is constructed using geom_step to represent the average hurricane count over time. Additionally, we include text annotations to indicate different types of hurricanes, such as "All Hurricanes" and "Major Hurricanes." The graph is color-coded to differentiate between different hurricane types using hex colors obtained from the original graph using the Image Color Picker tool.

### Graph Customization
To enhance the visual appeal, we customize various aspects of the graph. This includes adjusting scales for the x and y axes, removing gridlines, modifying axis ticks and lines, and applying a minimal theme. The title of the graph, "15-year average recorded Atlantic basin hurricanes, 1851-2019," provides a clear indication of the data presented.

### Footer
To complete the recreation, we add a footer displaying the source of the data and attribution. The footer consists of the text "FiveThirtyEight" and "SOURCES: HURDAT2, VECCHI ET AL" aligned at the bottom of the graph.

### Conclusion
By following the step-by-step process outlined in this article, we successfully recreated the graph from Anna Wiederkehr's insightful article on hurricane seasons. Through the use of ggplot2 and various customization techniques, we were able to visualize the 15-year average recorded Atlantic basin hurricanes from 1851 to 2019. This exercise serves as an excellent opportunity to enhance our data visualization skills and gain insights into the impact of past hurricane seasons on future predictions.

## Adding the text

## Labs

                              hjust = 0.50, vjust = 1)
  )
graph1
```

I used the [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en) tool to get the hex colors from the original graph.

We are still missing the footer, so let's add it.

```{r}

footer<- grobTree( 
                  textGrob("      FiveThirtyEight", x=unit(.05, "npc"), 
                      gp=gpar(col="#868686", 
                              family="sans", 
                              fontsize= 5.5,
                              fontface= "bold"),
                      hjust=0,
                      vjust = -2),
                  
                  textGrob("SOURCES: HURDAT2, VECCHI ET AL      ",
                        x=unit(1, "npc"), 
                        gp=gpar(col="#868686", 
                                family= "sans",
                                fontsize=5.5,
                              fontface= "bold"),
                        hjust=1,
                      vjust = -2))
                  
# Plot All Together

 plt.final <- grid.arrange(graph1, footer, heights=unit(c(0.72, 0.03), 
                                                    c("npc", "npc")))

```
