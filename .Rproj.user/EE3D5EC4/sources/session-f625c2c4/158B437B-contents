## Introduction

The purpose of this business report is to provide an overview of a project that analyzed a customer database from a mall. The project aimed to uncover underlying patterns in the customer base and group customers into segments, known as market segmentation. By understanding these segments, the marketing team can adopt a more targeted approach to reach consumers, and the mall can make informed strategic decisions to increase profits.

## Dataset and Methods Used

The dataset used in this analysis is a customer database from a mall, containing 200 observations with basic information such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The analysis was performed using the R programming language. Exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization, and unsupervised machine learning techniques (K-Means Clustering) were employed to achieve the project objectives.

## Project Highlights

The project yielded several important highlights and insights:

Age Distribution: The analysis of the age distribution revealed that the majority of customers in the database were adults below 40 years old. There were fewer middle-aged and older adults represented in the customer base.

Annual Income Distribution: The distribution of annual income showed that a significant number of customers had an income range of approximately $60,000 to $80,000 per year. However, there were fewer customers with higher annual incomes.

Spending Score Distribution: The distribution of spending scores exhibited a more balanced pattern, with a concentration around the mean value. However, there were still notable proportions of customers with both low and high spending scores.

Market Segmentation: Through the application of K-means clustering, the analysis identified five distinct customer segments based on their demographic and spending characteristics.

a. "Young and Moderate Income" Cluster: This segment consisted of young individuals with a moderate income level and average spending behavior.

b. "Middle-Aged and Moderate Income" Cluster: This segment represented middle-aged individuals with moderate incomes and average spending habits.

c. "Young and High Spending" Cluster: Despite having lower incomes, individuals in this cluster exhibited a tendency for high spending.

d. "Middle-Aged and Conservative Spending" Cluster: Customers in this cluster had higher incomes but conservative spending habits, emphasizing financial stability and savings.

e. "Young and High Income" Cluster: This segment consisted of young individuals with high incomes and high spending scores, representing an affluent customer group.

               select("Age", "AnnualIncome", "SpendingScore"),
               max_clusters = 10, plot_clusters = T, criterion = 'silhouette')
```
#### WCSSE

```{r}
Optimal_Clusters_KMeans <- function(data, max_clusters, plot_clusters = TRUE, criterion = 'WCSSE') {
  set.seed(123)
  
  # Function to calculate the total within-cluster sum of squares error (WCSSE)

## Cluster Analysis

"Young and Moderate Income" Cluster: This cluster consists of young individuals with a moderate income level and average spending behavior. To target this segment effectively, the marketing manager can focus on offering affordable products or services that align with the interests and preferences of this younger demographic. Promotional campaigns that highlight value for money, convenience, and trendy features could resonate well with this cluster.

"Middle-Aged and Moderate Income" Cluster: This cluster represents middle-aged individuals with moderate incomes and average spending habits. The marketing manager can target this segment by emphasizing quality, durability, and reliability in their products or services. Highlighting the long-term value and practicality of the offerings can be effective in capturing the attention of this cluster.

"Young and High Spending" Cluster: Despite their lower incomes, individuals in this cluster exhibit a tendency for high spending. The marketing manager can capitalize on this by offering attractive financing options, discounts, or loyalty programs that reward their spending. Promoting exclusive or unique experiences can also appeal to this segment, as they may prioritize indulgence and personal enjoyment.

"Middle-Aged and Conservative Spending" Cluster: With higher incomes but conservative spending habits, this cluster values financial stability and savings. The marketing manager can position products or services as long-term investments or solutions that offer cost savings in the long run. Emphasizing features such as durability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness can be effective in attracting this cluster.

"Young and High Income" Cluster: This cluster represents young individuals with high incomes and high spending scores. The marketing manager can focus on luxury, prestige, and personalized experiences to appeal to this affluent segment. Tailored marketing campaigns, exclusive offers, and high-end branding can effectively capture the attention and loyalty of this cluster.

It's important to further analyze the clusters and their characteristics in order to refine these recommendations and tailor them to the specific goals and objectives of the marketing manager and the business. Additionally, conducting market research and gathering customer insights will provide a more comprehensive understanding of each cluster's preferences and behaviors, enabling the marketing manager to create targeted and impactful marketing strategies.
